## üõ†Ô∏è Data Stores

The project supports two data store options:  

1. **In-Memory Data Store** *(default)*  
   - Used for easy configuration and testability.  
   - No setup required.  

2. **EF Core + SQL Server** *(optional)*  
   - For actual data persistence.  
   - To enable:  
     1. Install and configure **SQL Server**.  
     2. Update the connection string in:  
        ```json
        // IMS.WebApp/appSettings.Development.json
        "ConnectionStrings": {
          "InventoryManagement": "Your-SQL-Server-Connection-String"
        }
        ```  
     3. Open **Package Manager Console** in Visual Studio and run:  
        ```powershell
        Add-Migration InitialCreate
        Update-Database
        ```  
     4. Open `Properties/launchSettings.json` and ensure all `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` values are set to:  
        ```json
        "Development"
        ```

## üîë Authentication Setup (Optional)

By default, Microsoft Identity authentication is disabled in the in-memory setup.  
To enable authentication:  

1. Ensure a working SQL Server database is configured.  
2. Go to the **Pages** folder.  
3. Uncomment the `[Authorize]` attributes, for example:  
   ```csharp
   @attribute [Authorize(Policy = "Inventory")]
   ```

2. Open the solution in **Visual Studio 2022**.  
3. Run the project (defaults to **in-memory mode**).  
4. If needed, configure EF Core with SQL Server as described above.
